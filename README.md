This Python script will analyse the csv data sources by reading the files from data Folder.

It will then analyses the data and create the following:
  - summary statistics
  - bar charts and pie charts
  - quartiles and outliers calculation

  - correlation and regression calculation 

# Analysis points
  1. There were a total of 249 mice in the study where 50.7% were male and 49.3% were female.
  2. The average tumor volumes were lowest for the mice treated with Ramicane, and the second lowest is Capomulin, which indicates that the two treatments could be the most effective in reducing the tumours in mice.
  3. There is a strong positive correlation (0.84) between the average tumour volume and mouse weight. This shows that as the weight of the mice increases, the size of tumour also increases.
